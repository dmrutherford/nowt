add number of pending items count to nowt -e
warn that nowt -e is slow
find a faster way of doing nowt -e
is there a way of automatically modifying the PS1 prompt?
colourise nowt's output
namespace nowt variables
can we ditch the need for quotation marks?
perhaps make a global index of nowt projects, updated by -E
if global index, .nowt in ~ and .nowt-project for projects
